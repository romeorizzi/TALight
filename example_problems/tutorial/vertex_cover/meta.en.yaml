    description: 'This service provides you with a solution for a given instance of the Vertex Cover problem. You can either upload the instance file on the `instance` filehandler of the service, using the `-f` option of the `connect` subcommand of `rtal`, or try to input your instance directly from the terminal (supported only in `only_strings` format) once the service has started. You may also specify a pseudo-random instance by providing its instance description for a selected generator. This last option might ease your calling this service on instances encountered with other services.'
